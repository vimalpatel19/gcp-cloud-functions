# GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - Cloud Functions 

This repository contains various Cloud Functions (written in `Go`) used across various projects that I am developing on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/vimalpatel19).

### TODO
- [ ] Add documentation to README for deploying each Cloud Function
- [ ] Refactor code for resusability of common code across multiple functions
